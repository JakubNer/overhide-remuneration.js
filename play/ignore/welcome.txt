  The pane on the LEFT is the actual rendered 
  example application for you to interact with.

  The TOP-RIGHT pane shows "logs" logged from this
  test application. 
  
  When this test Web application's JavaScript 
  calls a "log" function, the logged message 
  appears in the TOP-RIGHT pane.

  Clicking any log message will scroll the 
  BOTTOM-RIGHT pane to the corresponding 
  JavaScript source code where this log message 
  occurs.
